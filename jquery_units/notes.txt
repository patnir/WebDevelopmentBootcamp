What is jQuery? 
	Helps us manipulate the DOM
	Javascript library
		We can take code that someone else wrote and we can use all its methods

Why use jQuery?
	Fixes broken DOM API 
	Brevity and Clarity
	Ease of use
	Cross Browser Support
	AJAX
	Lot's of people use it
Why not use it? 
	DOM API is not broken
	It doesn't do anything that you cannot do on your own
	It could be an unneccessary dependency
	Performance

$("css selector") always returns a list even though there is 1 item, unlike document.get...

$("#adorable")

$("selector").css("property", "value")

var styles = {
	backgroundColor: "pink",
	fontWeight: "bold"
}

$("special").css(styles);

or 

$("special").css({
	backgroundColor: "pink",
	fontWeight: "bold"
});
